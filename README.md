# Blackjack

Blackjack game with only one player. PDF file helped me to implement it but for trying to calcute the score of each hand I used another method in my program.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* python 2.7


### Installing

* Open terminal go to blackjack directory
* and execute the program with python 2.7

```
python2 blackjack.py
```

Or if you know that python 2.7 is the primary python in you operation system instead of python 3.6 then

```
python blackjack.py
```

## Built With

* [Blackjack OOP](https://github.com/bfarbod/blackjack/blob/master/Blackjack%20implementation%20guide.pdf) - PDF file for implementing blackjack from Object Oriented Programming perspective
